## Advanced Machine Learning Exercises

This repository contains my code and worked exercises on the concepts from the [Advanced Machine Learning](https://digital-sciences.de/en/modules/advanced-machine-learning/) course for the Digital Sciences Master's Degree at TH Köln.

The main topics are:  
* **Anomaly detection** (DBScan, isolation forest, robust random cut forest)
* **Autoencoders** (domain adaptation)
* **Variational autoencoders** (impact of KL-divergence loss on the latent space)
* **Generative adversarial networks** (conditional GANs)
* **Explainable AI** (PDP, ICE, Shapley values & LIME)
* **Reinforcement learning** (Q tables & deep Q networks)
